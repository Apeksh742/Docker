# Docker-project

** NOTE: Get one file only and the name of file must be docker-compose.yml only.

Requirements: docker-compose, docker and apache server

Method :

get docker-compose.yml and in same directory run  # docker-compose up

Alternate :

If earlier method doesn't work properly 

get docker-compose(1).yml and rename it to docker-compose.yml and in same directory run # docker-compose up
the container will get set-up and you will be ready to go
